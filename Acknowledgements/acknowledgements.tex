This project would not have been possible without the support and guidance of my mentor, Dr. Eric Green. I would also like to thank Mark Herzog, Katherine King, Daphine Aphina, and Ben Bellows for their research and logistical support throughout this process; the developers at InSTEDD for their support with the Verboice platform; Drs. Lavanya Vasudevan and Nimmi Ramanujam for their input and feedback as members of my thesis defense committee; and the AMPATH Consortium, Saving Lives at Birth Program, and Population Council for helping make this project a reality.  I would also like to thank the team of community health volunteers, clinic nurses, and women who took part in this project and helped us take steps in improving delivery of maternal and child health care in this community.
