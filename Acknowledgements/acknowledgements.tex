This project would not have been possible without the support and guidance of my mentor, Dr. Eric Green. Special thanks also go to Mark Herzog and Katey King, both of whom made invaluable contributions to this work at each and every stage. 

This project was supported by the Duke Global Health Institute, the Saving Lives at Birth Grand Challenge grant program, the Population Council, and the AMPATH Consortium.
