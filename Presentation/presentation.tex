\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Maternal Mortality}

\begin{frame}{What we know...}

\begin{block}{
Reducing maternal mortality is a major global health priority. }
%Every day, 800 women die of pregnancy-related complications around the world.
\end{block}
\begin{block}{
Most maternal deaths take place during a specific time period.}
%Most of these deaths take place during or within the first few days after childbirth.
\end{block}
\begin{block}{
The burden of maternal mortality is greatest in poor and remote areas.}
%Compared to women worldwide, 1 of 16 women in sub-Saharan Africa will die of pregnancy-related complications.
\end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{What we know...}

\uncover<1->{\begin{block}{Most maternal deaths are avoidable.}
%Skilled practices can prevent at least 80% of maternal deaths and 67% of all newborn deaths. 
\end{block}}

\uncover<2->{\begin{alertblock}{Three delay model for maternal mortality:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item<3->{Seeking care}
\item<4->{Accessing care}
\item<5->{Receiving care}
\end{enumerate}

\end{alertblock}}

%Explain three delays. These delays make safe maternal and child health practices very difficult to deliver.

\section{Results}
\subsection{System Design}
\begin{frame}[t]{Reporting Data}
\begin{itemize}
\item{CHVs submit reports every two weeks to the clinic}
\item{Approximately 5-6 months to visit each household in each village}
\item{Home visit information is hand-written, paper based}
\item{Collecting data on number of deliveries in the community is a key component of reports}
\item{Nurses rarely used CHV reports; presents challenges for preparing for prenatal, postnatal care at the clinic}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Reporting Data}
\begin{block}{\textcolor{IndianRed2}{Design Principle: Reporting home visits through IVR}}
\begin{itemize}
\item{CHV ''flashes'' the Baby Monitor number, receives free call back}
\item{Identify themselves as CHVs with their national ID number}
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics<2>[scale=0.25]{reportdel2}}
\end{block}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}[t]{Patient Referral}
\begin{itemize}
\item{CHVs carry ''referral books'' with sheets given to patients to take to clinic}
\item{Nurses estimated that 50 patients per week referred by CHVs}
\item{CHVs have no way of knowing whether patients followed up on their referrals}
\item{CHVs have no way of hearing about deliveries if not contacted directly}

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[t]{Patient Referral}
%Clinic visit notification
\begin{block}{\textcolor{IndianRed2}{Design Principle: Referral notifications through text message}}
\uncover<2->{\begin{itemize}
\item{Visits from enrolled pregnant women logged by clinic nurses, data entered into Baby Monitor database}
\item{R analysis script matched each woman who visited the clinic to the CHV assigned to her village of residence}
\item{Automated text messages sent the following morning}
\end{itemize}}
\uncover<2->{\textit{Hi. Betty Odong visited the clinic yesterday! This was her ANC 2 month visit. Please encourage her to continue attending appointments.}}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Patient Referral}
%Delivery notification
\begin{block}{\textcolor{IndianRed2}{Design Principle: Delivery notifications through text message}}
\uncover<2->{\begin{itemize}
\item{Family member ''flashes'' Baby Monitor number, receives free call back}
\item{Identical to CHV reporting call flow}
\item{R analysis script matches the woman reported to the CHV assigned to her village}
\item{Automated text messages sent the following morning}
\end{itemize}}
\uncover<2->{\textit{Hi. Betty Odong delivered her baby on 08-04-2014!}}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Emergency Response}
\begin{itemize}
\item{CHVs are usually called during an emergency}
\item{Recommend that the patient go to the clinic for immediate care}
\item{Often, the clinic was unprepared to handle an emergency case}
\item{Little to no direct communication between CHVs and clinic nurses about incoming emergencies}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Emergency Response}
%Emergency Reporting
\begin{block}{\textcolor{IndianRed2}{Design Principle: Reporting emergencies through IVR}}
\begin{itemize}
\item{CHV, mother, or family member ''flashes'' the Baby Monitor number, receives free call back}
\item{Indicate that they would like to report an emergency}
\end{itemize}
\centerline{\includegraphics<1>[scale=0.25]{reportem1}}
\end{block}
\end{frame}


\subsection{Usage and Usability}
\begin{frame}{Call Volume}
\begin{itemize}
\item{1,312 total calls registered from CHVs}
\item{401 valid calls registered from CHVs}
